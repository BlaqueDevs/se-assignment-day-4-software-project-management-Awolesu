# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?

Ans;
Timely project delivery is essential for any business operation, as it affects customer satisfaction, profitability, and reputation. However, many factors can cause delays, such as scope creep, resource constraints, communication breakdowns, and unexpected risks.
The important of time delivery in softwear management include;
1. Meeting Client Expectations
One of the most important reasons why timely deliveries are crucial in project management is that it helps in meeting client expectations.
2. Mitigating Risks
Timely deliveries also help in mitigating risks in project management. When projects are delivered on time, it reduces the chances of cost overruns, schedule delays, and other risks associated with project management.
3. Cost Savings
Delivering projects on time can also result in cost savings.
4. Improved Communication
Timely deliveries also help in improving communication between project teams and clients.
5. Competitive Advantage
Finally, timely deliveries can provide a competitive advantage in project management. Businesses that consistently deliver projects on time are more likely to win new clients and retain existing ones.
The following tips can keep your project on its desired trajectory even as it potentially changes hands, ensuring the project finishes on time and on budget (every project manager’s goal!). 
1. Know the strengths and weaknesses of your team
2. Document the scope of the project before you start
3. Set goals within realistic timelines
4. Make sure team members understand schedules and deadlines before launch
5.  Use collaboration tools
6. Communicate, communicate, communicate…
7. Know your red flags and watch for them
8. Celebrate milestones
9. Remember there’s no way every detail of every project can be under your control
10. Have contingency plans

Here comes the most important task for you as a project manager. Set a realistic deadline for the project tasks and activities due. Establish the resources for each task and set the deadline in line with each team member's capacity. Also, make sure to add contingency time to each project.

As a Restaurant Owner/Manager

1. Introduction

Restaurant managers are responsible for the daily operations of a restaurant that prepares and serves meals and beverages to customers. Strong planning skills, especially coordinating with the various departments (kitchen, dining room, banquet operations, food service managers, vendors providing the supplies) ensure that customers are satisfied with their dining experience. Managers’ abilities to recruit and retain employees, and monitor employee performance and training ensure quality with cost containment. Scheduling in many aspects, not only the staff but also the timing of the food service deliveries, is critical in meeting customer expectations.

Risk management is essential to ensure food safety and quality. Managers monitor orders in the kitchen to determine where delays may occur, and they work with the chef to prevent these delays. Legal compliance is essential in order for the restaurant to stay open, so restaurant managers direct the cleaning of the dining areas and the washing of tableware, kitchen utensils, and equipment. They ensure the safety standards and legality, especially in serving alcohol. Sensitivity and strong communication skills are needed when customers have complaints or employees feel pressured because more customers arrive than predicted.

Financial knowledge is needed for the soundness of running the restaurant, especially tracking special projects, events, and costs for the various menu selections. Catering events smoothly can be an outcome of using project plans and the philosophy of project management. The restaurant manager or the executive chef analyzes the recipes to determine food, labour, and overhead costs; determines the portion size and nutritional content of each serving; and assigns prices to various menu items,so that supplies can be ordered and received in time.

Planning is the key for successful implementation. Managers or executive chefs need to estimate food needs, place orders with distributors, and schedule the delivery of fresh food and supplies. They also plan for routine services (equipment maintenance, pest control, waste removal) and deliveries, including linen services or the heavy cleaning of dining rooms or kitchen equipment, to occur during slow times or when the dining room is closed. A successful restaurant relies on many skill
that the project management profession emphasizes.

Outsourcing Services. Many businesses explore outsourcing for certain services. Below is a sample status and project plan that reflects the various tasks needed for a project. A review of finances, the importance of communicating to stakeholders, and the importance of time, cost, schedule, scope, and quality are reflected. Many companies may use these steps in their business. These plans show the need for the entire team to review the various proposals to choose the best plan. Figure 1.1 represents a sample project status report.


2. Project Management Overview

Definition of a Project
The project is to  establish an Agricultureal Resturant where delivery will be done to the customer. Agricultural resturant is a market place where you can shop for agricutural product remotely, having a real market experience. The client can price same agricutural product as well order for food. what this project will do is like making client to have real market experiences.
Project Characteristics

When considering whether or not you have a project on your hands, there are some things to keep in mind. First, is it a project or an ongoing operation? Second, if it is a project, who are the stakeholders? And third, what characteristics distinguish this endeavor as a project?

A.Projects have several characteristics:
Projects are unique.
Projects are temporary in nature and have a definite beginning and ending date.
Projects are completed when the project goals are achieved or it’s determined the project is no longer viable.

B.The Process of Project Management
Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques applied to project activities in order to meet the project requirements. Project management is a process that includes planning, putting the project plan into action, and measuring progress and performance.

c. Project Management Expertise
Knowing which ones affect your project before you begin work will not only help the project to unfold smoothly, but will also allow for effective risk analysis.

4. The Project Life Cycle (Phases)
   A.Initiation Phase: Once the recommended solution is approved, a project is initiated to deliver the approved solution and a project manager is appointed. The major deliverables and the participating work groups are identified, and the project team begins to take shape. Approval is then sought by the project manager to move onto the detailed

b. Planning Phase: will want to document a quality plan, providing quality targets, assurance, and control measures, along with an acceptance plan, listing the criteria to be met to gain customer acceptance. At this point, the project would have been planned in detail and is ready to be executed.
c. Implementation (Execution) Phase: During the third phase, the implementation phase, the project plan is put into motion and the work of the project is performed.

d.Closing Phase: During the final closure, or completion phase, the emphasis is on releasing the final deliverables to the customer, handing over project documentation to the business, terminating supplier contracts, releasing project resources, and communicating the closure of the project to all stakeholders.

 5. Framework for Project Management
    
The PMI is responsible for developing and promoting PMBOK. PMI also administers a professional certification program for project managers, the PMP. So if you want to get grounded in project management, PMBOK is the place to start, and if you want to make project management your profession, then you should consider becoming a PMP.
So what is PMBOK? PMBOK is the fundamental knowledge you need for managing a project, categorized into 10 knowledge areas:
PMBOK is the fundamental knowledge you need for managing a project, categorized into 10 knowledge areas:
i Managing integration: Projects have all types of activities going on and there is a need to keep the “whole” thing moving collectively – integrating all of the dynamics that take place. Managing integration is about developing the project charter, scope statement, and plan to direct, manage, monitor, and control project change.
ii Managing scope: Projects need to have a defined parameter or scope, and this must be broken down and managed through a work breakdown structure or WBS.  Managing scope is about planning, definition, WBS creation, verification, and control.
iii Managing time/scheduule: Projects have a definite beginning and a definite ending date. Therefore, there is a need to manage the budgeted time according to a project schedule.Managing time/schedule is about definition, sequencing, resource and duration estimating, schedule development, and schedule control.
iv. Managing costs: Projects consume resources, and therefore, there is a need to manage the investment with the realization of creating value (i.e., the benefits derived exceed the amount spent).  Managing costs is about resource planning, cost estimating, budgeting, and control.
v. Managing quality: Projects involve specific deliverables or work products. These deliverables need to meet project objectives and performance standards. Managing quality is about quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control.
vi. Managing human resources: Projects consist of teams and you need to manage project team(s) during the life cycle of the project.Finding the right people, managing their outputs, and keeping them on schedule is a big part of managing a project. Managing human resources is about human resources planning, hiring, and developing and managing a project team.
v11. Managing communication: Projects invariably touch lots of people, not just the end users (customers) who benefit directly from the project outcomes. This can include project participants, managers who oversee the project, and external stakeholders who have an interest in the success of the project.  Managing communication is about communications planning, information distribution, performance reporting, and stakeholder management.
viii. Managing risk: Projects are a discovery-driven process, often uncovering new customer needs and identifying critical issues not previously disclosed. Projects also encounter unexpected events, such as project team members resigning, budgeted resources suddenly changing, the organization becoming unstable, and newer technologies being introduced. There is a real need to properly identify various risks and manage these risks. Managing risk is about risk planning and identification, risk analysis (qualitative and quantitative), risk response (action) planning, and risk monitoring and control.
ix. Managing procurement: Projects procure the services of outside vendors and contractors, including the purchase of equipment. There is a need to manage how vendors are selected and managed within the project life cycle. Managing procurement is about acquisition and contracting plans, sellers’ responses and selections, contract administration, and contract closure.
x. Managing stakeholders: Every project impacts people and organizations and is impacted by people and organizations. Identifying these stakeholders early, and as they arise and change throughout the project, is a key success factor. Managing stakeholders is about identifying stakeholders, their interest level, and their potential to influence the project; and managing and controlling the relationships and communications between stakeholders and the project.
According to the PMI, the scope statement should include the following:
Description of the scope
Product acceptance criteria
Project deliverables
Project exclusions
Project constraints
Project assumptions 

6. Stakeholder Management

A project is successful when it achieves its objectives and meets or exceeds the expectations of the stake­holders. But who are the stakeholders? Stakeholders are individuals who either care about or have a vested interest in your project. They are the people who are actively involved with the work of the project or have something to either gain or lose as a result of the project.

a. Project Stakeholders
Top Management
Top management may include the president of the company, vice-presidents, directors, division managers, the corporate operating committee, and others. These people direct the strategy and development of the organization
b.  The Project Team
The project team is made up of those people dedicated to the project or borrowed on a part-time basis. 

7. Culture and Project Management
   What Is Organizational Culture?
When working with internal and external customers on a project, it is essential to pay close attention to relationships, context, history, and the corporate culture. Corporate culture refers to the beliefs, attitudes, and values that the organization’s members share and the behaviours consistent with them (which they give rise to). Corporate culture sets one organization apart from another, and dictates how members of the organization will see you, interact with you, and sometimes judge you. Often, projects too have a specific culture, work norms, and social conventions.

8. Project Initiation
The project initiation phase is the first phase within the project management life cycle, as it involves starting up a new project. Within the initiation phase, the business problem or opportunity is identified, a solution is defined, a project is formed, and a project team is appointed to build and deliver the solution to the customer. A business case is created to define the problem or opportunity in detail and identify a preferred solution for implementation. The business case includes:
a. A detailed description of the problem or opportunity with headings such as Introduction, Business Objectives, Problem/Opportunity Statement, Assumptions, and Constraints
b. A list of the alternative solutions available
c. An analysis of the business benefits, costs, risks, and issues
d. A description of the preferred solution
e. Main project requirements
f. A summarized plan for implementation that includes a schedule and financial analysis

9. Overview of Project Planning

Project planning is at the heart of the project life cycle, and tells everyone involved where you’re going and how you’re going to get there. The planning phase is when the project plans are documented, the project deliverables and requirements are defined, and the project schedule is created. It involves creating a set of plans to help guide your team through the implementation and closure phases of the project. The plans created during this phase will help you manage time, cost, quality, changes, risk, and related issues. They will also help you control staff and external suppliers to ensure that you deliver the project on time, within budget, and within schedule.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

Ans;
The Benefits of Project Cost Control Brings to Your Project

Effective cost control ensures that a project’s budget is on track and the project is progressing and will be completed according to its planned scope. Without cost control, when taking on large-scale projects, a company can easily lose money as unrestrained costs exceed the project’s profit.

By using a cost report, your organization will have an actual indicative status of the project, whether it currently has a cost savings or budget overrun.

This is especially useful when a client receives an early indication that the project is going over budget. Then the client and the team can then make all necessary measures to mitigate the budget overrun. Early indication can enable you to make a turning point from budget overrun to break-even or cost savings.Implementing Project Cost Control for Small Businesses

Usually, major or established companies already have extensive project cost control processes in place. However, many small and medium businesses (SMBs) are still missing out on this beneficial process.

The following are some common reasons why SMBs may not have a project cost control process:
 Small and medium businesses are often focused on growing through gaining more projects, but not realizing the need to implement control practices like project cost control as they scale.
The management of a small company may think that implementing cost control processes will cost them time and effort; they may be hesitant to make changes to current processes they’re already familiar with.
A company’s management might also be hesitant because of the perceived cost implications of such processes. Often, a company’s management will be so focused on the initial cost impact that they do not realize that having such processes is actually an investment which will later give them a good return by enabling them to take on more extensive and complex projects.
Project management and project cost control can help organizations of all sizes, regardless of size. It works for small and medium businesses just as it does for large, complex projects. Implementing project cost control as a regular process sooner rather than later (even if you start out small) is recommended so that as you grow, you’ll already be equipped to handle challenging situations and projects with confidence.
This will give you peace of mind that your investments will produce a positive ROI both in the present and as you expand in the future.

What Is Cost Overrun?

The term cost overrun refers to unexpected costs that end up exceeding a project budget. Cost overrun can occur in any project and it’s particularly common in construction, manufacturing and software development projects. Cost overrun is also known as a cost increase or budget overrun and can be caused for several reasons.
Here are seven tips to help keep reigns on your budget.
1. Thorough Project Planning

The best way to stop cost overrun is to plan against it before executing a project. The more thorough and accurate your estimates, the more likely you’ll stay within budget. The project risks can be accounted for with an exhaustive risk management plan. When planning for any project, you must consider all possible scenarios and use historical data, interviews and experience. Once that plan has been detailed, have it signed off by the stakeholders of the project so everyone is on the same page in terms of expectations.
2. Know Your Vendors

Many projects require assistance from outside vendors, whether to help with specific tasks or supply materials and equipment. A relationship with any outside vendor opens your project up to cost overruns that are often beyond your control. This makes it critical to do due diligence before relationships are cemented.

First, understand the capacity of the vendor and if they’re going to meet your needs. When the vendor quotes a cost, make sure it’s accurate. Then, before signing the contract, do a bit of background-checking to see if the vendor meets deadlines and see what others have to say about working with them.
3. Keep to Planned Scope

Scope creep is one of the biggest threats to sending a project into cost overrun. Change requests always bog down the desks of project managers. These come from stakeholders or clients, but also from team members. They all have wants and needs. Many of them may be appropriate and even beneficial to the project. However, too many changes can drastically impact the project, making cost overruns unavoidable. Put thought into the big picture before you increase project scope.
4. Use a Project Planning Tool

It’s a given that a powerful tool will make make a project manager’s work easier, add to the productivity of the project and increase efficiencies. It also assists in keeping cost overruns at a minimum. A scheduling tool like a Gantt chart can help keep the project on track and prevent cost overruns.
Gantt chart with task information panel
5. Keep Stakeholders Updated

If there isn’t a clear line of communication between stakeholders and project managers, delays are inevitable. Delays lead to cost overruns and there’s too great of a risk that work will start on the wrong task at the wrong time. This wasted time threatens to send the whole project off track.

Stakeholders, as well as teams, need proper communication, but each should get the right information. Teams want details while stakeholders want broad strokes to make sure the project is progressing as planned.
6. Monitor Progress

The real-time dashboard from ProjectManager is also ideal for tracking the progress of a project as it happens. Before issues become problems that threaten the project’s schedule and budget, they can be resolved. The real-time dashboard measures not only the project’s progress but the team’s workload and timelines for planned and actual completion, including project slippage and more.
7. Reassign Resources

If you discover a project that’s spending more than budgeted, you’re going to respond by reallocating resources. But you can also prepare for that scenario by evaluating resources beforehand and placing them where they’ll be most effective. This is especially true with your most valuable resource: your team.

By assembling the most experienced and skilled team members, you can have a more productive and efficient project. These resources might cost more, but if you’ve done your planning and set aside funds, you’ll save money on the backend when there are fewer issues to handle.


## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Ans;

10 differences between waterfall and agile

Here are 10 critical differences between the waterfall and agile project management methods:

1 Roles: Waterfall strictly assigns roles to project team members, with specific duties and responsibilities defined for each team member. In contrast, the agile model empowers team members to collaborate on different aspects of the project over time, leading to a more self-organizing team structure.
2. Planning: In waterfall, planning is a linear process done at the beginning of the project, with all requirements and objectives laid out in detail upfront. In contrast, agile planning is a continuous process throughout the project's life cycle, with adjustments made as new information or requirements emerge.
3. Scope: The waterfall methodology generally discourages changes to the project's scope, even with change requests used correctly. This is because the methodology requires an extensive amount of time spent in the beginning trying to get the plan right, which can make changes more costly after the project has begun. On the other hand, agile is more adaptable to changes in scope, with the development team able to adjust quickly as requirements change.
4. Time frames: The waterfall method is designed for long-term projects with predetermined timelines. The project is completed linearly, with each phase dependent on the previous one. Agile, however, uses short iterations to deliver value rapidly, allowing teams to adjust plans over time and achieve shorter time frames.
5. Speed: Waterfall projects tend to take longer because all requirements must be agreed upon before development can begin. Agile projects, on the other hand, are usually delivered more rapidly than waterfall projects due to the iterative development cycles used in agile.
6. Delivery: Agile allows for quick delivery of projects with shorter lifecycles, as each iteration delivers a workable product. Waterfall requires the completion of all tasks before any work can be released.
7. Flexibility: Agile encourages teams to respond quickly and adaptively to changes during the development process. Waterfall is less flexible and resistant to change once the project's scope has been defined.
8. Testing: Testing is essential to the agile and waterfall methodologies, but the approaches differ significantly. Agile emphasizes incremental testing to identify and resolve issues throughout the development process. In waterfall, testing is usually done at specific milestones, often towards the end of the project.
9. Documentation: Agile relies on minimal documentation, focusing on self-organizing teams and collaboration. Waterfall, in contrast, relies heavily on documenting each step in detail to ensure that all team members are on the same page.
10. Communication: Agile emphasizes informal communication, with frequent interactions between individuals or small groups of stakeholders. In waterfall, communication is more formal, with detailed communication plans and progress reports shared across multiple stakeholders.

When to use agile vs. waterfall

Waterfall project management best suits well-defined projects with clearly specified requirements, limited complexity, and a definitive timeline. Waterfall works well when the customer's demands are precise and when there are no significant changes in scope or technology during the project.

The waterfall model fits projects with the following characteristics:

    Simple scope and requirement gathering
    Clear and linear sequence of tasks
    Predictable deliverables based on set deadlines
    Structured processes
    Rigid quality control measures
    Long-term commitment from all parties involved

Agile project management is a good fit in cases where the end goal may be unclear or difficult to define, when complex systems require frequent feedback loops, or when timelines and budgets are tight. It is also particularly effective for developing software applications since it allows for quick iteration and testing along the way. Additionally, agile can be helpful when dealing with teams who need to collaborate intensively, such as those located in different locations.

Agile project management can be an excellent fit for many teams and projects, especially those that meet the criteria below:

    Complex deliverables
    Frequent iterations and refinements
    Rapid delivery times
    Emergent requirements
    Collaborative environments
    Multiple stakeholders

5 example scenarios where you can benefit from Agile
Diving further, here are some specific scenarios, types of projects, and environments that often benefit from an agile approach to project delivery:

1. Technical projects: Agile provides teams with an organized approach to developing complex software or products. Multiple teams can collaborate orderly, without a 45-person planning or re-planning meeting.
2. Creative projects: Projects that involve a lot of creative problem-solving benefit from an agile approach as it allows for more experimentation and innovative thinking.
3. Product innovation and development: Organizations that need to stay ahead of their competition by developing new products or improving existing ones will benefit from an agile workflow, as it allows team members to have increased flexibility throughout the process.
4. Startups: They often need to deliver products or services with limited resources quickly. Agile methods allow them to develop and implement ideas more rapidly, allowing for rapid prototyping and iteration on the fly.
5. Rapid prototyping: Agile can be used to quickly prototype and deliver an end product with high quality without spending too much time on planning, sourcing, approvals, etc.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

Ans:

Quality Assurance is a set of structured and planned activities necessary for the extraction of satisfying results essential for software improvement. Software quality assurance does not only limit its procedure till the creation of the product, but it also deals with its developmental phases.Three Basic Strategies of Quality Control

One of three strategies used to ensure quality is given as:
1. Failure testing

Failure testing is the process of repeatedly testing a product to see if it breaks or fails. This might include testing the product under heat, pressure, or vibration if it is a physical product that has to endure stress. Failure testing for software products may entail putting the software through intense experience or load situations.
2. Statistical process control

(SPC) is a methodology created by Walter Shewhart in the 1920s and 1930s focused on verifiable research and information. To manage and regulate product manufacturing, this system uses statistical methods.
3. Total quality management (TQM)

It is a strategy of constant improvement that uses quantitative approaches. TQM depends on facts and evidence, including analytics, to assist product performance and project assessments.
Systematic Investigation Of Software Development:
Anything just doesn’t magically come into being but requires some preplanning and before and preparations.

The software development process is no different from any other process of product making. It also involves four preparatory steps to meet the demands of customers.

First, the standards and methods are identified, which are essential for developing the software.
Secondly, these standards and methods are inspected to review the quality.
Thirdly, the software is expected to undergo different tests to examine its performance and record the data.
At last, a course of action is taken to collect the performance record of the software and the employees in the form of a    document. 

Methods Of Software Quality Assurance:

Now let’s move on to the part that will do justice to you! The company runs the newly created software through various testing procedures using several techniques.

So that the customer gets the right product that he had paid for, or maybe only had given the advance payment, anyway!

The list of methods used for Software Quality Assurance is as follows:
1. AUDIT:

Involves the inspection of the progress and the product to determine whether the set of actions written in the original document that should be followed are being followed or not!
2. REVIEW:

    Process in which both developers and customers gather for a meeting to:
    examine the progress and product
    clients give their approval
    comments
    suggests the implementation he wants to his product

3. BUG DETECTION:

    Professional and trained group of people go through a static set of tests to find the bugs and defects in the project based on the rules and criteria of the project.
    These inspections are kept confidential from the clients.

4. DESIGN INSPECTION:

Developers produce a list according to which the software is designed that examines the following areas of software design:

    General requirements and design
    Functional and Interface specifications
    Conventions
    Requirement traceability
    Structures and interfaces
    Logic
    Performance
    Error handling and recovery
    Testability, extensibility
    Coupling and cohesion

5. SIMULATION:

Simulation is a process of virtually examining the software by using the tools that develop real-life situations, and this interesting method is used to assess the behavior of the software.
6. FUNCTIONAL TESTING:

Also known as BLACK BOX TESTING, it determines the features of the software, giving insight into what the project does without inspecting how so.
7. STANDARDIZATION:

It releases the vagueness of the product, thus giving a clear image of the quality of the software.
8. STATIC SCANNING:

It is the process of analyzing the software using automated tools. This method inspects automated tools to test the product without interfering with the product’s system. 
9. WALKTHROUGHS:

Now the HIGHER UPS employees have been reporting to are given a job. Yes! They were not only involved in ordering around but had an essential share in the whole procedure.
They are given access to the project to:
1. to examine the software
2. raise their queries related to the product
3. develop the solutions to the defect if any
4. point out any errors and any other issues and suggestions.

10. PATH TESTING:

Also known as a WHITE BOX TESTING TECHNIQUE tests out each command and path designed and installed in the software.
11. STRESS TESTING:
In this method, it is inspected whether the project would break or collapse under the stressed environment, different from the conditions in which the system is designed and trained.
12. SIX SIGMA QUALITY ASSURANCE:
The sole purpose of using this technique is to elevate the quality and efficiency of the system up to 99.7%, free from any bugs, errors, and defects.
Impact of Software Quality Assurance Methodologies On Business
Why does a company go through all that hassle, or, these organizations, why does the customer choose to pay only if the good quality of the product is assured?

Only a few mistakes and your hard-found reputation can be gone, creating major barriers in the way of sales and, consequently, loss of trust of your dear customers.

Quality is the sole and most important element that distinguishes one product from another. Along with Software Quality Assurance, the quality with which the product is delivered should also be praised.
Software Quality Assurance helps organizations to produce defect and error-free products that could meet the requirements and transport them to demanding customers.
The higher the quality the more satisfied customers are.
software quality assurance ensures the acquiree of customer’s trust, more purchases, and progressive growth of the business 
If the SQ is assured, then all the cases where the customer demands free inspection of the product due to arousal of any defect could be prevented by 99%.
Free services to the customers and possible chances of product return due to rejections can be avoided.
Companies only need to do things once, but by making sure they are doing it right, there will be less rework, less variation in design, better performance overall, and money savings.
Good, solid popularity is hard to make and easy to lose.
