# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?

Ans;
Timely project delivery is essential for any business operation, as it affects customer satisfaction, profitability, and reputation. However, many factors can cause delays, such as scope creep, resource constraints, communication breakdowns, and unexpected risks.
The important of time delivery in softwear management include;       
1. Meeting Client Expectations
One of the most important reasons why timely deliveries are crucial in project management is that it helps in meeting client expectations.
2. Mitigating Risks
Timely deliveries also help in mitigating risks in project management. When projects are delivered on time, it reduces the chances of cost overruns, schedule delays, and other risks associated with project management.
3. Cost Savings
Delivering projects on time can also result in cost savings.
4. Improved Communication
Timely deliveries also help in improving communication between project teams and clients.
5. Competitive Advantage
Finally, timely deliveries can provide a competitive advantage in project management. Businesses that consistently deliver projects on time are more likely to win new clients and retain existing ones.
The following tips can keep your project on its desired trajectory even as it potentially changes hands, ensuring the project finishes on time and on budget (every project manager’s goal!). 
1. Know the strengths and weaknesses of your team
2. Document the scope of the project before you start
3. Set goals within realistic timelines
4. Make sure team members understand schedules and deadlines before launch
5.  Use collaboration tools
6. Communicate, communicate, communicate…
7. Know your red flags and watch for them
8. Celebrate milestones
9. Remember there’s no way every detail of every project can be under your control
10. Have contingency plans

Here comes the most important task for you as a project manager. Set a realistic deadline for the project tasks and activities due. Establish the resources for each task and set the deadline in line with each team member's capacity. Also, make sure to add contingency time to each project.

As a Restaurant Owner/Manager

1. Introduction

Restaurant managers are responsible for the daily operations of a restaurant that prepares and serves meals and beverages to customers. Strong planning skills, especially coordinating with the various departments (kitchen, dining room, banquet operations, food service managers, vendors providing the supplies) ensure that customers are satisfied with their dining experience. Managers’ abilities to recruit and retain employees, and monitor employee performance and training ensure quality with cost containment. Scheduling in many aspects, not only the staff but also the timing of the food service deliveries, is critical in meeting customer expectations.

Risk management is essential to ensure food safety and quality. Managers monitor orders in the kitchen to determine where delays may occur, and they work with the chef to prevent these delays. Legal compliance is essential in order for the restaurant to stay open, so restaurant managers direct the cleaning of the dining areas and the washing of tableware, kitchen utensils, and equipment. They ensure the safety standards and legality, especially in serving alcohol. Sensitivity and strong communication skills are needed when customers have complaints or employees feel pressured because more customers arrive than predicted.

Financial knowledge is needed for the soundness of running the restaurant, especially tracking special projects, events, and costs for the various menu selections. Catering events smoothly can be an outcome of using project plans and the philosophy of project management. The restaurant manager or the executive chef analyzes the recipes to determine food, labour, and overhead costs; determines the portion size and nutritional content of each serving; and assigns prices to various menu items,so that supplies can be ordered and received in time.

Planning is the key for successful implementation. Managers or executive chefs need to estimate food needs, place orders with distributors, and schedule the delivery of fresh food and supplies. They also plan for routine services (equipment maintenance, pest control, waste removal) and deliveries, including linen services or the heavy cleaning of dining rooms or kitchen equipment, to occur during slow times or when the dining room is closed. A successful restaurant relies on many skill
that the project management profession emphasizes.

Outsourcing Services. Many businesses explore outsourcing for certain services. Below is a sample status and project plan that reflects the various tasks needed for a project. A review of finances, the importance of communicating to stakeholders, and the importance of time, cost, schedule, scope, and quality are reflected. Many companies may use these steps in their business. These plans show the need for the entire team to review the various proposals to choose the best plan. Figure 1.1 represents a sample project status report.


2. Project Management Overview

Definition of a Project
The project is to  establish an Agricultureal Resturant where delivery will be done to the customer. Agricultural resturant is a market place where you can shop for agricutural product remotely, having a real market experience. The client can price same agricutural product as well order for food. what this project will do is like making client to have real market experiences.
Project Characteristics

When considering whether or not you have a project on your hands, there are some things to keep in mind. First, is it a project or an ongoing operation? Second, if it is a project, who are the stakeholders? And third, what characteristics distinguish this endeavor as a project?

A.Projects have several characteristics:
Projects are unique.
Projects are temporary in nature and have a definite beginning and ending date.
Projects are completed when the project goals are achieved or it’s determined the project is no longer viable.

B.The Process of Project Management
Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques applied to project activities in order to meet the project requirements. Project management is a process that includes planning, putting the project plan into action, and measuring progress and performance.

c. Project Management Expertise
Knowing which ones affect your project before you begin work will not only help the project to unfold smoothly, but will also allow for effective risk analysis.

4. The Project Life Cycle (Phases)
   A.Initiation Phase: Once the recommended solution is approved, a project is initiated to deliver the approved solution and a project manager is appointed. The major deliverables and the participating work groups are identified, and the project team begins to take shape. Approval is then sought by the project manager to move onto the detailed

b. Planning Phase: will want to document a quality plan, providing quality targets, assurance, and control measures, along with an acceptance plan, listing the criteria to be met to gain customer acceptance. At this point, the project would have been planned in detail and is ready to be executed.
c. Implementation (Execution) Phase: During the third phase, the implementation phase, the project plan is put into motion and the work of the project is performed.

d.Closing Phase: During the final closure, or completion phase, the emphasis is on releasing the final deliverables to the customer, handing over project documentation to the business, terminating supplier contracts, releasing project resources, and communicating the closure of the project to all stakeholders.

 5. Framework for Project Management
    
The PMI is responsible for developing and promoting PMBOK. PMI also administers a professional certification program for project managers, the PMP. So if you want to get grounded in project management, PMBOK is the place to start, and if you want to make project management your profession, then you should consider becoming a PMP.
So what is PMBOK? PMBOK is the fundamental knowledge you need for managing a project, categorized into 10 knowledge areas:
PMBOK is the fundamental knowledge you need for managing a project, categorized into 10 knowledge areas:
i Managing integration: Projects have all types of activities going on and there is a need to keep the “whole” thing moving collectively – integrating all of the dynamics that take place. Managing integration is about developing the project charter, scope statement, and plan to direct, manage, monitor, and control project change.
ii Managing scope: Projects need to have a defined parameter or scope, and this must be broken down and managed through a work breakdown structure or WBS.  Managing scope is about planning, definition, WBS creation, verification, and control.
iii Managing time/scheduule: Projects have a definite beginning and a definite ending date. Therefore, there is a need to manage the budgeted time according to a project schedule.Managing time/schedule is about definition, sequencing, resource and duration estimating, schedule development, and schedule control.
iv. Managing costs: Projects consume resources, and therefore, there is a need to manage the investment with the realization of creating value (i.e., the benefits derived exceed the amount spent).  Managing costs is about resource planning, cost estimating, budgeting, and control.
v. Managing quality: Projects involve specific deliverables or work products. These deliverables need to meet project objectives and performance standards. Managing quality is about quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control.
vi. Managing human resources: Projects consist of teams and you need to manage project team(s) during the life cycle of the project.Finding the right people, managing their outputs, and keeping them on schedule is a big part of managing a project. Managing human resources is about human resources planning, hiring, and developing and managing a project team.
v11. Managing communication: Projects invariably touch lots of people, not just the end users (customers) who benefit directly from the project outcomes. This can include project participants, managers who oversee the project, and external stakeholders who have an interest in the success of the project.  Managing communication is about communications planning, information distribution, performance reporting, and stakeholder management.
viii. Managing risk: Projects are a discovery-driven process, often uncovering new customer needs and identifying critical issues not previously disclosed. Projects also encounter unexpected events, such as project team members resigning, budgeted resources suddenly changing, the organization becoming unstable, and newer technologies being introduced. There is a real need to properly identify various risks and manage these risks. Managing risk is about risk planning and identification, risk analysis (qualitative and quantitative), risk response (action) planning, and risk monitoring and control.
ix. Managing procurement: Projects procure the services of outside vendors and contractors, including the purchase of equipment. There is a need to manage how vendors are selected and managed within the project life cycle. Managing procurement is about acquisition and contracting plans, sellers’ responses and selections, contract administration, and contract closure.
x. Managing stakeholders: Every project impacts people and organizations and is impacted by people and organizations. Identifying these stakeholders early, and as they arise and change throughout the project, is a key success factor. Managing stakeholders is about identifying stakeholders, their interest level, and their potential to influence the project; and managing and controlling the relationships and communications between stakeholders and the project.
According to the PMI, the scope statement should include the following:
Description of the scope
Product acceptance criteria
Project deliverables
Project exclusions
Project constraints
Project assumptions 

6. Stakeholder Management

A project is successful when it achieves its objectives and meets or exceeds the expectations of the stake­holders. But who are the stakeholders? Stakeholders are individuals who either care about or have a vested interest in your project. They are the people who are actively involved with the work of the project or have something to either gain or lose as a result of the project.

a. Project Stakeholders
Top Management
Top management may include the president of the company, vice-presidents, directors, division managers, the corporate operating committee, and others. These people direct the strategy and development of the organization
b.  The Project Team
The project team is made up of those people dedicated to the project or borrowed on a part-time basis. 

7. Culture and Project Management
   What Is Organizational Culture?
When working with internal and external customers on a project, it is essential to pay close attention to relationships, context, history, and the corporate culture. Corporate culture refers to the beliefs, attitudes, and values that the organization’s members share and the behaviours consistent with them (which they give rise to). Corporate culture sets one organization apart from another, and dictates how members of the organization will see you, interact with you, and sometimes judge you. Often, projects too have a specific culture, work norms, and social conventions.

8. Project Initiation
The project initiation phase is the first phase within the project management life cycle, as it involves starting up a new project. Within the initiation phase, the business problem or opportunity is identified, a solution is defined, a project is formed, and a project team is appointed to build and deliver the solution to the customer. A business case is created to define the problem or opportunity in detail and identify a preferred solution for implementation. The business case includes:
a. A detailed description of the problem or opportunity with headings such as Introduction, Business Objectives, Problem/Opportunity Statement, Assumptions, and Constraints
b. A list of the alternative solutions available
c. An analysis of the business benefits, costs, risks, and issues
d. A description of the preferred solution
e. Main project requirements
f. A summarized plan for implementation that includes a schedule and financial analysis

9. Overview of Project Planning

Project planning is at the heart of the project life cycle, and tells everyone involved where you’re going and how you’re going to get there. The planning phase is when the project plans are documented, the project deliverables and requirements are defined, and the project schedule is created. It involves creating a set of plans to help guide your team through the implementation and closure phases of the project. The plans created during this phase will help you manage time, cost, quality, changes, risk, and related issues. They will also help you control staff and external suppliers to ensure that you deliver the project on time, within budget, and within schedule.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

Ans;
The Benefits of Project Cost Control Brings to Your Project

Effective cost control ensures that a project’s budget is on track and the project is progressing and will be completed according to its planned scope. Without cost control, when taking on large-scale projects, a company can easily lose money as unrestrained costs exceed the project’s profit.

By using a cost report, your organization will have an actual indicative status of the project, whether it currently has a cost savings or budget overrun.

This is especially useful when a client receives an early indication that the project is going over budget. Then the client and the team can then make all necessary measures to mitigate the budget overrun. Early indication can enable you to make a turning point from budget overrun to break-even or cost savings.Implementing Project Cost Control for Small Businesses

Usually, major or established companies already have extensive project cost control processes in place. However, many small and medium businesses (SMBs) are still missing out on this beneficial process.

The following are some common reasons why SMBs may not have a project cost control process:
 Small and medium businesses are often focused on growing through gaining more projects, but not realizing the need to implement control practices like project cost control as they scale.
The management of a small company may think that implementing cost control processes will cost them time and effort; they may be hesitant to make changes to current processes they’re already familiar with.
A company’s management might also be hesitant because of the perceived cost implications of such processes. Often, a company’s management will be so focused on the initial cost impact that they do not realize that having such processes is actually an investment which will later give them a good return by enabling them to take on more extensive and complex projects.
Project management and project cost control can help organizations of all sizes, regardless of size. It works for small and medium businesses just as it does for large, complex projects. Implementing project cost control as a regular process sooner rather than later (even if you start out small) is recommended so that as you grow, you’ll already be equipped to handle challenging situations and projects with confidence.
This will give you peace of mind that your investments will produce a positive ROI both in the present and as you expand in the future.

What Is Cost Overrun?

The term cost overrun refers to unexpected costs that end up exceeding a project budget. Cost overrun can occur in any project and it’s particularly common in construction, manufacturing and software development projects. Cost overrun is also known as a cost increase or budget overrun and can be caused for several reasons.
Here are seven tips to help keep reigns on your budget.
1. Thorough Project Planning

The best way to stop cost overrun is to plan against it before executing a project. The more thorough and accurate your estimates, the more likely you’ll stay within budget. The project risks can be accounted for with an exhaustive risk management plan. When planning for any project, you must consider all possible scenarios and use historical data, interviews and experience. Once that plan has been detailed, have it signed off by the stakeholders of the project so everyone is on the same page in terms of expectations.
2. Know Your Vendors

Many projects require assistance from outside vendors, whether to help with specific tasks or supply materials and equipment. A relationship with any outside vendor opens your project up to cost overruns that are often beyond your control. This makes it critical to do due diligence before relationships are cemented.

First, understand the capacity of the vendor and if they’re going to meet your needs. When the vendor quotes a cost, make sure it’s accurate. Then, before signing the contract, do a bit of background-checking to see if the vendor meets deadlines and see what others have to say about working with them.
3. Keep to Planned Scope

Scope creep is one of the biggest threats to sending a project into cost overrun. Change requests always bog down the desks of project managers. These come from stakeholders or clients, but also from team members. They all have wants and needs. Many of them may be appropriate and even beneficial to the project. However, too many changes can drastically impact the project, making cost overruns unavoidable. Put thought into the big picture before you increase project scope.
4. Use a Project Planning Tool

It’s a given that a powerful tool will make make a project manager’s work easier, add to the productivity of the project and increase efficiencies. It also assists in keeping cost overruns at a minimum. A scheduling tool like a Gantt chart can help keep the project on track and prevent cost overruns.
Gantt chart with task information panel
5. Keep Stakeholders Updated

If there isn’t a clear line of communication between stakeholders and project managers, delays are inevitable. Delays lead to cost overruns and there’s too great of a risk that work will start on the wrong task at the wrong time. This wasted time threatens to send the whole project off track.

Stakeholders, as well as teams, need proper communication, but each should get the right information. Teams want details while stakeholders want broad strokes to make sure the project is progressing as planned.
6. Monitor Progress

The real-time dashboard from ProjectManager is also ideal for tracking the progress of a project as it happens. Before issues become problems that threaten the project’s schedule and budget, they can be resolved. The real-time dashboard measures not only the project’s progress but the team’s workload and timelines for planned and actual completion, including project slippage and more.
7. Reassign Resources

If you discover a project that’s spending more than budgeted, you’re going to respond by reallocating resources. But you can also prepare for that scenario by evaluating resources beforehand and placing them where they’ll be most effective. This is especially true with your most valuable resource: your team.

By assembling the most experienced and skilled team members, you can have a more productive and efficient project. These resources might cost more, but if you’ve done your planning and set aside funds, you’ll save money on the backend when there are fewer issues to handle.


## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Ans;

10 differences between waterfall and agile

Here are 10 critical differences between the waterfall and agile project management methods:

1 Roles: Waterfall strictly assigns roles to project team members, with specific duties and responsibilities defined for each team member. In contrast, the agile model empowers team members to collaborate on different aspects of the project over time, leading to a more self-organizing team structure.
2. Planning: In waterfall, planning is a linear process done at the beginning of the project, with all requirements and objectives laid out in detail upfront. In contrast, agile planning is a continuous process throughout the project's life cycle, with adjustments made as new information or requirements emerge.
3. Scope: The waterfall methodology generally discourages changes to the project's scope, even with change requests used correctly. This is because the methodology requires an extensive amount of time spent in the beginning trying to get the plan right, which can make changes more costly after the project has begun. On the other hand, agile is more adaptable to changes in scope, with the development team able to adjust quickly as requirements change.
4. Time frames: The waterfall method is designed for long-term projects with predetermined timelines. The project is completed linearly, with each phase dependent on the previous one. Agile, however, uses short iterations to deliver value rapidly, allowing teams to adjust plans over time and achieve shorter time frames.
5. Speed: Waterfall projects tend to take longer because all requirements must be agreed upon before development can begin. Agile projects, on the other hand, are usually delivered more rapidly than waterfall projects due to the iterative development cycles used in agile.
6. Delivery: Agile allows for quick delivery of projects with shorter lifecycles, as each iteration delivers a workable product. Waterfall requires the completion of all tasks before any work can be released.
7. Flexibility: Agile encourages teams to respond quickly and adaptively to changes during the development process. Waterfall is less flexible and resistant to change once the project's scope has been defined.
8. Testing: Testing is essential to the agile and waterfall methodologies, but the approaches differ significantly. Agile emphasizes incremental testing to identify and resolve issues throughout the development process. In waterfall, testing is usually done at specific milestones, often towards the end of the project.
9. Documentation: Agile relies on minimal documentation, focusing on self-organizing teams and collaboration. Waterfall, in contrast, relies heavily on documenting each step in detail to ensure that all team members are on the same page.
10. Communication: Agile emphasizes informal communication, with frequent interactions between individuals or small groups of stakeholders. In waterfall, communication is more formal, with detailed communication plans and progress reports shared across multiple stakeholders.

When to use agile vs. waterfall

Waterfall project management best suits well-defined projects with clearly specified requirements, limited complexity, and a definitive timeline. Waterfall works well when the customer's demands are precise and when there are no significant changes in scope or technology during the project.

The waterfall model fits projects with the following characteristics:

    Simple scope and requirement gathering
    Clear and linear sequence of tasks
    Predictable deliverables based on set deadlines
    Structured processes
    Rigid quality control measures
    Long-term commitment from all parties involved

Agile project management is a good fit in cases where the end goal may be unclear or difficult to define, when complex systems require frequent feedback loops, or when timelines and budgets are tight. It is also particularly effective for developing software applications since it allows for quick iteration and testing along the way. Additionally, agile can be helpful when dealing with teams who need to collaborate intensively, such as those located in different locations.

Agile project management can be an excellent fit for many teams and projects, especially those that meet the criteria below:

    Complex deliverables
    Frequent iterations and refinements
    Rapid delivery times
    Emergent requirements
    Collaborative environments
    Multiple stakeholders

5 example scenarios where you can benefit from Agile
Diving further, here are some specific scenarios, types of projects, and environments that often benefit from an agile approach to project delivery:

1. Technical projects: Agile provides teams with an organized approach to developing complex software or products. Multiple teams can collaborate orderly, without a 45-person planning or re-planning meeting.
2. Creative projects: Projects that involve a lot of creative problem-solving benefit from an agile approach as it allows for more experimentation and innovative thinking.
3. Product innovation and development: Organizations that need to stay ahead of their competition by developing new products or improving existing ones will benefit from an agile workflow, as it allows team members to have increased flexibility throughout the process.
4. Startups: They often need to deliver products or services with limited resources quickly. Agile methods allow them to develop and implement ideas more rapidly, allowing for rapid prototyping and iteration on the fly.
5. Rapid prototyping: Agile can be used to quickly prototype and deliver an end product with high quality without spending too much time on planning, sourcing, approvals, etc.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

Ans:

Quality Assurance is a set of structured and planned activities necessary for the extraction of satisfying results essential for software improvement. Software quality assurance does not only limit its procedure till the creation of the product, but it also deals with its developmental phases.Three Basic Strategies of Quality Control

One of three strategies used to ensure quality is given as:
1. Failure testing

Failure testing is the process of repeatedly testing a product to see if it breaks or fails. This might include testing the product under heat, pressure, or vibration if it is a physical product that has to endure stress. Failure testing for software products may entail putting the software through intense experience or load situations.
2. Statistical process control

(SPC) is a methodology created by Walter Shewhart in the 1920s and 1930s focused on verifiable research and information. To manage and regulate product manufacturing, this system uses statistical methods.
3. Total quality management (TQM)

It is a strategy of constant improvement that uses quantitative approaches. TQM depends on facts and evidence, including analytics, to assist product performance and project assessments.
Systematic Investigation Of Software Development:
Anything just doesn’t magically come into being but requires some preplanning and before and preparations.

The software development process is no different from any other process of product making. It also involves four preparatory steps to meet the demands of customers.

First, the standards and methods are identified, which are essential for developing the software.
Secondly, these standards and methods are inspected to review the quality.
Thirdly, the software is expected to undergo different tests to examine its performance and record the data.
At last, a course of action is taken to collect the performance record of the software and the employees in the form of a    document. 

Methods Of Software Quality Assurance:

Now let’s move on to the part that will do justice to you! The company runs the newly created software through various testing procedures using several techniques.

So that the customer gets the right product that he had paid for, or maybe only had given the advance payment, anyway!

The list of methods used for Software Quality Assurance is as follows:
1. AUDIT:

Involves the inspection of the progress and the product to determine whether the set of actions written in the original document that should be followed are being followed or not!
2. REVIEW:

    Process in which both developers and customers gather for a meeting to:
    examine the progress and product
    clients give their approval
    comments
    suggests the implementation he wants to his product

3. BUG DETECTION:

    Professional and trained group of people go through a static set of tests to find the bugs and defects in the project based on the rules and criteria of the project.
    These inspections are kept confidential from the clients.

4. DESIGN INSPECTION:

Developers produce a list according to which the software is designed that examines the following areas of software design:
General requirements and design
Functional and Interface specifications
Conventions
Requirement traceability
Structures and interfaces
Logic
Performance
Error handling and recovery
Testability, extensibility
Coupling and cohesion

5. SIMULATION:

Simulation is a process of virtually examining the software by using the tools that develop real-life situations, and this interesting method is used to assess the behavior of the software.
6. FUNCTIONAL TESTING:

Also known as BLACK BOX TESTING, it determines the features of the software, giving insight into what the project does without inspecting how so.
7. STANDARDIZATION:

It releases the vagueness of the product, thus giving a clear image of the quality of the software.
8. STATIC SCANNING:

It is the process of analyzing the software using automated tools. This method inspects automated tools to test the product without interfering with the product’s system. 
9. WALKTHROUGHS:

Now the HIGHER UPS employees have been reporting to are given a job. Yes! They were not only involved in ordering around but had an essential share in the whole procedure.
They are given access to the project to:
1. to examine the software
2. raise their queries related to the product
3. develop the solutions to the defect if any
4. point out any errors and any other issues and suggestions.

10. PATH TESTING:

Also known as a WHITE BOX TESTING TECHNIQUE tests out each command and path designed and installed in the software.
11. STRESS TESTING:
In this method, it is inspected whether the project would break or collapse under the stressed environment, different from the conditions in which the system is designed and trained.
12. SIX SIGMA QUALITY ASSURANCE:
The sole purpose of using this technique is to elevate the quality and efficiency of the system up to 99.7%, free from any bugs, errors, and defects.
Impact of Software Quality Assurance Methodologies On Business
Why does a company go through all that hassle, or, these organizations, why does the customer choose to pay only if the good quality of the product is assured?

Only a few mistakes and your hard-found reputation can be gone, creating major barriers in the way of sales and, consequently, loss of trust of your dear customers.

Quality is the sole and most important element that distinguishes one product from another. Along with Software Quality Assurance, the quality with which the product is delivered should also be praised.
Software Quality Assurance helps organizations to produce defect and error-free products that could meet the requirements and transport them to demanding customers.
The higher the quality the more satisfied customers are.
software quality assurance ensures the acquiree of customer’s trust, more purchases, and progressive growth of the business 
If the SQ is assured, then all the cases where the customer demands free inspection of the product due to arousal of any defect could be prevented by 99%.
Free services to the customers and possible chances of product return due to rejections can be avoided.
Companies only need to do things once, but by making sure they are doing it right, there will be less rework, less variation in design, better performance overall, and money savings.
Good, solid popularity is hard to make and easy to lose.


## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

Ans;
Project scope is a part of the project planning process that documents specific goals, deliverables, features, and budgets. The scope document details the list of activities for the successful completion of the project.

The scope is defined by understanding the project requirements and the client’s expectations. The scope statement usually contains,
1. project objectives
2. project deliverables
3. exclusions
4. project constraints and
5. project assumptions.

Importance of project scope management
For a project manager, managing the expectations of the stakeholders and clients is one of the most challenging tasks. With a definite project scope, managers can easily stay on track and ensure that all the deadlines are being followed throughout the project life cycle.
A well-defined project scope management helps avoid common issues like:
i Constantly changing requirements
ii. Pivoting the project direction when you are already mid-way
iii. Realizing that the final outcome isn’t what was expected
iv. Going over the discussed budget
v. Falling behind the project deadlines

Effective project scope management gives a clear idea about the time, labor, and cost involved in the project. It helps to distinguish between what is needed and what isn’t needed for accomplishing the project. Scope in project management also establishes the control factors of the project to address elements that might change during the project life cycle.
Work breakdown structure takes a large project and, quite literally, breaks it down into smaller components. This makes it easier for teams to identify scope, cost and deliverables and delegate tasks to the team members who are best suited for the job.
What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

Making a WBS is the first step in developing a project schedule. It defines all the work that needs to be completed (and in what order) to achieve the project goals and objectives. By visualizing your project in this manner, you can understand your project scope, and allocate resources for all your project tasks.

A well-constructed work breakdown structure helps with important project management process groups and knowledge areas such as: 
Project Planning, Project Scheduling and Project Budgeting
Risk Management, Resource Management, Task Management and Team Management
In addition, a WBS helps avoid common project management issues such as missed deadlines, scope creep and cost overrun, among others.
In other words, a work breakdown structure serves as your map through complicated projects. Your project scope may include several phases or smaller sub-projects—and even those sub-projects can be broken down into tasks, deliverables, and work packages! Your WBS can help you manage those items, and gain clarity into the details needed to accomplish every aspect of your project scope.
Here are many ways in which you can use a work breakdown structure to help you manage work. Here are three common examples of how to use a WBS for different purposes.
Scope of Work
A scope of work is a comprehensive document that explains your project scope, which is all the work to be performed. A WBS is the perfect tool to break down the scope of a project into work packages that are easier to control. On top of that, a work breakdown structure allows you to easily identify milestones, deliverables and phases.
Statement of Work
A statement of work is a legally binding document between a client and the organization who’s responsible for executing a project. It details project management aspects such as the timeline, deliverables, requirements of the project.
Work Order
A work order is similar to a statement of work, but it’s main purpose is to show the costs associated with each task. A WBS is essential for an accurate cost estimation.


## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Ans;

Developing a project schedule is essential for project planning and management. A detailed project schedule can help to:
a. Ensure that all tasks are completed on time and within budget
b. Identify potential scheduling conflicts and risks
c. Allocate resources effectively
d. Monitor project progress and make adjustments as necessary
By including a detailed project schedule as part of the project plan, project managers can help to ensure that the project is completed successfully and on time.

Gantt charts help teams to plan work around deadlines and properly allocate resources. Project planners also use Gantt charts to maintain a bird's eye view of projects. They depict, among other things, the relationship between the start and end dates of tasks, milestones, and dependent tasks.
Benefits of a Gantt Chart
The Gantt chart identifies tasks that may be executed in parallel and those that can’t be started or finished until others are complete. It can help detect potential bottlenecks and identify tasks that may have been excluded from the project timeline.
The chart depicts things like task slack time or additional time for completion of a task that shouldn’t delay the project; noncritical activities that may be delayed; and critical activities that must be executed on time.
Gantt charts can be used in managing projects of all sizes and types. These may include building infrastructures like dams, bridges, and highways. They may also include software development and other technologies. Project management tools, such as Microsoft Visio, Project, SharePoint, and Excel, or specialized software, such as Gantto or Matchware, can help in designing Gantt charts. 

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?

 Ans;
 
1. Ever Changing Software Requirements
We know this thing from the beginning of software requirements do keep on changing but keeping a close eye on them is extremely important. Unclear requirements often result in unwanted mishaps and misfortunes. In addition, not understanding the needs right also leads to a huge waste of time and cost.
Here let me help you with an example, you are planning to buy a new car with some specific turbo engine requirements such as fuel type, power or torque and a lot more. And If you keep on adding to the requirements, your scope changes and so does the development. This will lead to a substantial increase in cost as well as development time.

Solution
So what could be the solution here? First of all, before even implementing a software development project just make sure that your developers exactly know what you want. And maybe that’s the reason why businesses are asked to document certain such things in advance.
When you hire a reliable software development company just ensure that they are willing fully interested in understanding your needs and requirements by asking you a plethora of relevant questions.
In addition, try breaking things into small milestones so that you can keep a keen check on your software projects at regular intervals

2 Software Bugs and Broken Code
Software testing was once considered an afterthought. This is one of the major problems created by software developers all across the globe. Underestimating the formal quality assurance process during software product development is the biggest issue here.

Solution
As a solution, software development and software testing must go hand-in-hand, as this will surely lead to a successful launch. Seek out achievable small, baby steps or milestones and ask your development team to keep on validating at every stage of your software project.
Treating a problem at the source is much more effective than addressing a symptom. Take the time to consider what the root of the problem is—whether it’s a lack of time, skill, or oversight. This will yield huge savings in time and effort over simply hiring more developers. After all we have been knowing for years that slow and steady to win the race.

3 Collaborative Communication
Communication has been one of the major issues, especially in the information technology industry. They are coders or programmers, most of them are geeks who might not be able to communicate well. Effective communication is the key here and if not done properly then It might lead to delay of the software solution or even cost you unnecessary money.

Solution
As a solution, conducting meetings at regular intervals or jotting down information, proper documentation brainstorming or web-based communication or choosing any platform that is easy and accessible to all. With effective communication, potential errors can be reduced to a great extent. Also, software development projects can be delivered in the nick of time.

4 Time Estimation
Everyone says time is of utmost importance and today estimating time is one of the crucial yet common problems especially faced among software developers. You see new technologies keep on popping every now and then. And as soon as developers get to know about one aspect of the next thing in line they get in the dilemma of how to use it at the right time. Choose developers on how to make a good estimate.

Solution
In addition, give each task a time frame for completion, but try to give yourself a buffer, too. For example, set yourself a buffer by keeping the time frame at 30 minutes if a task would normally take 20 minutes. Because you never know what disturbance or circumstances may occur.

5 Security
With so many security breaches happening day in and day out, web applications must be fully secured and that’s the duty of your software development team to take care of. So how do you cope with evolving security threats? How do you keep each layer of your software or application secure?

Simple if everyone sticks to their specific roles and responsibility. You see, security is not just the responsibility of the software engineer but also the responsibility of all the stakeholders involved including the project management, project managers, business analysts, quality assurance managers, technical architects, and application and developers. Also, there are certain best practices that must be considered account:
a. Look beyond new technologies to improve the security of your software
b. Develop software using high-level programming languages with built-in security features
c. Require security assurance activities such as penetration testing and code review
d. Perform essential core activities to produce secure applications and systems

6 Implementation

Of course, planning and plotting is something I am sure you must be very much focused on but all this works when it’s being implemented in the right way. You see software development is not a one time process or has a push-button it can be successfully done by implementing a step-by-step plan.
Choose a software development team that does know how to ideate as well as implement things in the right way. And even after you have a software solution at hand, just ensure that your chosen development team is right there for maintenance and support.

7 Premature Optimization
Premature optimization mostly occurs when there is a lack of a robust code reviewal in the whole procedure of software development.
Whenever it comes to coding, speed is frequently prioritized over cleanness and legitness. Developers frequently fall into the trap of focusing on producing optimized code that runs quickly rather than code that can be read, understood, and updated over time.
Code that is difficult to read can slow down your team, especially when programmers come and go. You’ve got a serious problem if a software product developer comes in and can’t decipher code.
Premature optimization is most common when there isn’t a robust code review procedure in place. Things get ugly and cause trouble down the line if this crucial step is skipped.

8 Confidentiality of Business Information
Understanding the confidentiality of business deals with the part where you know which information to share and which shouldn’t be shared. It might possibly make you feel overwhelmed.Thus, you need to be extra cautious while dealing with third party companies and sharing your financial information to them. But there is a solution to this oversharing of information. 
In such cases, one should be concerned that their ideas or trade secrets are safe and not stolen or disclosed.
For this, signing an NDA is a one-stop solution. A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is a viable option. A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is a legal contract between two parties, such as the software provider and you, that outlines the information to be given and requires that it be kept confidential.

9 Cross-Platform Functionality

Cross-platform applications have become the need of the hour and every business is making its way towards it. Software development companies are expected to provide a unified—or rather, “seamless” experience to users across all platforms, channels, and devices. This omnichannel experience is bringing more customer satisfaction and adding a lot to the business.
Cross-platform apps offer a slew of advantages to everyone from small businesses to giant corporations: Maintenance and deployment are simple: Cross-platform mobile apps minimise the need for additional effort during development and can be easily maintained across many platforms, such as iOS and Android.
One of the most difficult tasks for software development teams is to maintain consistency in tone, language, and appearance across all touchpoints while also being prepared to provide on-demand help wherever consumers choose to contact them. One of the easiest ways to please customers is to add cross-functionalities within their business offerings. 
 
##9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?

Ans;
Before you can solve a problem, you need to understand it clearly and completely. This means defining the scope, goals, constraints, and assumptions of the problem, as well as identifying the stakeholders, users, and requirements of the system.

Software developer jobs today require that you possess excellent problem-solving skills, and for good reason. Unfortunately, there seems to be a sort of talent gap when it comes to this one skill required of all software developers.

Troubleshooting and problem resolution are both informally and formally taught, but you mostly find that software developers have to learn problem-solving skills on their own. This is true for self-taught developers, obviously, but also even for those with software engineering degrees or who’ve graduated from coding boot camps.

This is why it’s necessary to acquaint yourself with the problem-solving process, whether you are a newbie or an experienced developer. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about problem-solving so you can 10x your software development career.
In software development, problem-solving is the process of using theories and research to find solutions to a problem domain, while testing different ideas and applying best practices to achieve a desired result. Problem-solving also has to do with utilizing creativity and logical thought processes to identify problems and resolve them with software.

Becoming a great software developer hinges more on learning algorithms than programming languages or frameworks. And algorithms are simply step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem.

Types of problem-solving skills
Now let’s talk about four types of problem-solving skills for developers:

1.  Parallel thinking
As a software developer, parallel thinking is a crucial skill necessary to perform optimally. This makes it possible for you to carry out two tasks that complement each other at the same time (like an optimized form of multitasking skills). Being able to reorder tasks to boost parallel execution can help to improve your output and save valuable time.

2. Dissecting broad and/or complex goals
When it comes to building software, you will need to effectively outline the steps and tasks necessary to achieve your goal. Developers must learn to break large and complex tasks into smaller assignments because this is an important skill that will help you create results with precision.

3. Reimplementing existing solutions
You don’t always need to reinvent the wheel. Part of being an effective software developer comes with being able to use already existing tools before even thinking of creating new solutions. Developing problem-solving skills is very much connected to finding solutions that already exist and reusing them.

4. Abstraction
Keep in mind that goals tend to evolve. So if your client comes up with new ideas, that will mean changing your design goals and reordering your tasks. A good programmer must learn to create solutions in such a way that does not require a complete redesign from scratch.
You also have to become adept at abstracting problems so that your solutions can get them resolved so long as they aren’t entirely different from the original issue. You don’t necessarily have to abstract every aspect to avoid more complications being created. This calls for balance by abstracting only where necessary without making narrow decisions.

Problem-Solving Stages & Practices

There are countless problem-solving processes and various schools of thought regarding the best way to approach problems whenever they arise. To solve that problem, we’ve pooled some of these frameworks together to come up with a comprehensive approach to problem-solving.

Step 1 – Define the problem
You have to first start with problem identification. Knowing what you are dealing with is important, because you don’t want to risk spending valuable time applying wrong solutions. Avoid making automatic assumptions. Even when the symptoms look familiar, you want to investigate properly because such signs could be pointing to something else entirely.
Problems in software development come in different sizes and scopes. You could be having trouble getting some aspects of the product to respond in the desired way. Or maybe you’re having issues trying to decipher a codebase section where you can no longer communicate with the original developers. Sometimes, the problem could come in the form of an unfamiliar error message and you’re at loss.
Once you’re able to define the problem, make sure to document it.

Step 2 – Analyze the problem
Now it’s time to carry out problem analysis. Before deciding what problem resolution methods to adopt, it’s necessary to find out all there is to the issue, which builds on our first step. This will make it easier to come up with ideas and solutions later on.
Problem analysis isn’t always a walk in the park. There are times when the problem involves a very small mistake such as failing to import a package correctly or a small syntax error. Other times, however, it could be such a huge error, like the entire program acting differently than what you want. There might be no alarms or blinking red lights to tell you what the exact problem is.
If you encounter such situations, you can find answers by articulating the problem. Document what you intend to do, what you’ve done, the original intention for the program, and where you currently are. Communication comes in handy here, of course, not just in your documentation, but also in how you relay it to your teammates.

Step 3 – Brainstorm

This step has to do with generating ideas, and you can benefit from discussing the problem with a team and then coming up with ways to get it fixed. Keep in mind that problem-solving at work involves interacting with a diverse group of people where the individuals have unique skill sets and experiences.
Many developers tend to neglect the previous steps and rush straight into brainstorming. That’s definitely not a good way to go about problem-solving. The idea is not to skip the important steps in the process.
Once you get to the point where ideas need to be generated, do not discard any, because this step relies on a wide range of ideas. Only after gathering as many perspectives as possible should you then begin reviewing and narrowing down to the best possible solution.

Step 4 – Make a decision
At this point, all viable solutions have to be analyzed before selecting the most appropriate one to implement. Picking the best possible solution depends on its ability to meet certain criteria. It must be suitable, feasible, and then acceptable.
What it means is that the solution must be able to get the problem solved. It should also be easy to see how such a solution fits into the equation. And then every member of the team involved in the brainstorming process has to unanimously accept the solution.

Step 5 – Implement
After identifying and choosing the solution, the next logical step is to plan out the implementation process and then execute it. Coming up with a detailed plan is crucial if the solution is to be a success.
Now this plan must detail all the necessary steps required to implement the solution. It will also explain the length of time and stages of work required. Once all of that is put in place, you can then move forward with the execution. The idea is not just to execute a solution but to do it the right way.
Implementation using automated tests can help to keep unexpected issues from arising in the future. Some other problem-solving practices or approaches begin the process with this step. So, whenever any changes are made to the project, tests asserting that the changes will perform as required will be written first before the changes are then made.

Step 6 – Evaluate
No problem-solving process can be deemed comprehensive enough if there is no room for evaluation. Whatever the solution may be, it has to undergo strict evaluation in order to see how it performs. That will also help determine whether the problem still exists and the extent to which such an issue keeps recurring.
In the event that the problem persists despite the implementation of a detailed plan, then the developer and team may even have to restart the problem-solving process. However discouraging that may sound, at least you’ll have caught it early enough. And, this also proves the process worked.

Final Thoughts
Developing problem-solving skills is quite necessary for software developers. To be a successful problem solver, you will need lots of years down the line to practice what you study.
Always remember that you are a problem solver first before anything else. There is more to building software than just understanding the tech behind it and writing lines of code. It’s all about improving your ability to identify problems and find solutions, and that will need lots of experience on your part.
Never shy away from problems, but learn to think critically and logically in any situation. By applying the six-step strategy for problem-solving at work discussed in this piece, you will be more equipped to come up with the most effective and efficient solutions.


## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?

Ans;
A 'Software Solution' refers to a range of software programs and packages designed to address various security needs, such as IDSes, firewalls, antivirus programs, and network management tools, including operating system and application patches for security vulnerabilities.
Software solutions consist of integrated sets of software applications, tools, and services that are developed to meet the requirements of various industries, functions, and processes within an organization. They are typically designed to improve operational workflows, facilitate data management and analysis, enhance collaboration and communication, and support decision-making processes. Software solutions can range from off-the-shelf products to customized systems tailored to the unique needs of a particular business.Software solutions play a pivotal role in enabling organizations to streamline operations, enhance customer relationships, make informed decisions, bolster cybersecurity defenses, and harness the power of cloud computing. In this article, we’ll explore five popular types of software solutions that companies across industries rely on to achieve their business objectives: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Business Intelligence (BI) and Analytics, Cybersecurity Solutions, and Cloud-based Services. Let’s delve into each of these solutions and discover how they empower businesses to succeed in a dynamic and digital-driven world.



## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?

Ans;
1 Functionality
The functionality of software refers to its ability to perform and function according to design specifications. In simple terms, software systems should function correctly, i.e. perform all the functions for which they are designed. 
The functions refer to the features that the end user, as well as the business, expect as basic facilities from the system. All these functions must be integrated into the system. Many software applications out there are designed for simplicity, but ultimately, the purpose of the software is to provide its users with the desired functionality.  In order to look like the best software product, it must have a clear appearance, components, and functions. However, there are also those products out there that can provide a great deal of value for your money. 

2. Usability (User-friendly)
The user-friendliness of the software is characterized by its ease of use. In other words, learning how to use the software should require less effort or time. Navigating the software is extremely important since it helps determine the journey the user takes within the software.  This is imperative to ensure visitors remain on your website and have a positive experience, which leads to an increase in sales and brand loyalty.
An important indicator of a good piece of software is its user interface, i.e., the smooth flow of its design. A product with a great UI (User Interface) design is more likely to get noticed than one without. If a software program isn’t user-friendly, users may have trouble navigating the software and using some of its features. Software should require less time or effort to learn. Ideally, software should be easy to use even by people with no IT experience.

3. Efficiency
Essentially, it refers to the software’s ability to utilize human and system resources such as time, effort, CPU, memory, computation power, network bandwidth, files, databases, etc., as effectively and efficiently as possible. For a software project to succeed, efficiency is crucial. In addition to meeting the needs for which the software was made, it must also provide excellent features designed to assist users in completing their tasks faster. Software should make efficient use of storage space and execute commands according to timing requirements. 
In order to be efficient, software must offer users proper value in terms of their time and cash. The market is filled with products that cater to various industries, but only a handful of products are efficient enough to benefit individuals and businesses. The medical billing software that Open Practice Solutions provides, for instance, makes billing processes much more efficient for clients than those offered by other companies.

4. Flexibility 
Software Flexibility refers to the ability of the software solution to adapt to potential or future changes in its requirements. When evaluating the flexibility of software, look at how simple it is to add, modify, or remove features without interfering with the current operation.
It is essential to keep up with rapidly changing markets, technologies, and customer needs. In software development, change is inevitable; it can arise during the development process itself or as the result of future requirements. Flexibility is therefore highly valued. Consequently, any software product must be scalable, flexible, and easily adaptable to future technology. When designing or building a software product, be sure to plan for these changes that are inevitably going to occur. Loose coupling of components is the key to creating highly flexible systems.

5. Reliability
The reliability of a software product describes the likelihood it will operate without failure over a specified period of time under certain conditions. It determines the ability of software to maintain its level of performance (provide desired functionality) under specified conditions for a specified period of time. Generally speaking, software reliability is measured as the availability of the software. The value should not be less than 99%. In reliability testing, the goal is not perfection, but achieving a level of reliability that is acceptable before a software product is released to customers. MTTF, MTTR, MTBR, etc., are some reliability metrics that can be used to quantify the reliability of a software product.


It is regarded as one of the most important quality aspects of software quality, along with functionality, efficiency, maintainability, etc. Since software tends to be complex, it is hard to achieve software reliability. 

6. Maintainability
Maintainability refers to how easily you can repair, improve and comprehend software code. In some ways, maintaining is similar to being flexible. Maintainability deals with the modification of errors and minor alterations to software code, while flexibility focuses on major functional extensions. It also involves maintaining the services and functionality of the software.
Most of the time, developers are not the ones who maintain the software. Therefore, good documentation is crucial, which includes code documentation, interface definitions, etc. The maintainability of software products is affected by the quality of the documentation. Typically, more than half of development budgets are spent on software maintenance. Maintenance should therefore be integrated into the development lifecycle for effective software maintenance.

7. Portability
Software portability is a critical factor that cannot be ignored. Portability refers to the ability to use software in different environments. This is the ease with which software can be ported from one platform to another without (or with minimal) changes, while obtaining similar results. As simple as it may sound, it refers to the ability of software to work on different hardware platforms without any (or little) modifications needed.
Furthermore, you should be aware that porting software to a new environment is comparatively cheaper than developing an equivalent application from scratch. There can be no doubt that portability is a crucial aspect of reducing development costs.

9. Integrity
There are multiple interpretations of software integrity. Some people tend to associate integrity with security, believing it is resistant to hacks and privacy violations. To others, high integrity means that the software cannot be modified without authorization. Integrity is key for demonstrating the safety, security, and maintainability of your software. In addition, software that needs to be compliant with industry regulations and coding standards requires high code integrity. Achieving software integrity can be difficult. Yet, with the right practices to improve safety, security, and maintainability, the challenge can be easily overcome. In these days of increased security threats, all software must include this factor.

Conclusion
The process of software engineering begins with analyzing the needs of the users and culminates in designing, developing, and testing software that meets those needs. One of the biggest challenges in the software engineering field is the ever-increasing demand for speedy turnaround times. As we have discussed in this article, there are some characteristics of good software that can make your software stand out from the crowd. 
The characteristics above are easy to find in a great product due to today’s heightened levels of design knowledge among software developers. It simply depends on how well resources are used to produce a high-quality software product. The significance of any one of these characteristics will vary depending on the application. Integrity and reliability factors are paramount in systems where lives are at stake. Whenever developing a business-related application, usability and maintainability are important factors to consider. As always, when it comes to Software Engineering, quality is everything. Create a product that possesses all of these qualities and characteristics.

Market size is the number of individuals in a certain market who are potential customers of your product or service. Depending on your distribution strategy, you’ll probably also want to look at the number of potential sellers of your product or service. 
When measuring market size there are two ways to approach it: top down and bottom up. 
Bottom up market sizing
For the bottom up approach you look at your own segment data, and then you look at secondary research to understand what’s expected to happen to those segments.
Although the bottom up approach can be more time consuming and will require you to better study and analyse your market, at the end it results in a more realistic and trustworthy number.
For example, let’s say 60% of your marketing agency business goes to big corporations, and 40% goes to small and medium-sized companies. If secondary research of your market says that big corporations are relying less on agency work because they’re hiring in-house teams and you know there’s an increase in the number of new startups entering your market, then you can act accordingly and focus on providing better solutions to SMBs.
These two ways to calculate market size help you understand the size of the opportunity in any given market. That said, it’s also important to consider other factors such as the indirect competition.
